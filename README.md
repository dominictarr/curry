CURRY
=====

(don't be alarmed I'm doing some commits to this project to test my integration server)

#curry function without anything *too clever*
_(... because hunger is the finest spice)_

can curry left an right and pass in a context object in one easy call.

    var fn = curry([left],function,[right],self)

wrap your curry args in Arrays

calling `fn(x)` will stick `x` in between left and right curry ingredients.

*left* and *right* are _*Arrays*_, and are _optional_.

i.e.

    var fn = curry(funx,[1,2,3])

is the same as

    var fn = curry([],funx,[1,2,3])

this makes `fn(X)` call `funx(X,1,2,3)`

##calling styles:

in all, there are 8 ways to call the function.

    curry([left],fn,[right])
    curry(fn,[right])
    curry([left],fn)
    curry(fn)

    curry([left],fn,[right],self)
    curry(fn,[right],self)
    curry([left],fn,self)
    curry(fn,self)
